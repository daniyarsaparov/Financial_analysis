    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "These numbers show the charge-off rates for each grade category. We can see that the \n",
    "percentage of charge-off the rates are different for each group. It looks like the charge-off rates for the grade-G borrowers is much higher than those of grade-A. From this we can understand that the people in grade-G tend to not pay back their loan and this leads to higher risk of loss of money. And grade-A group has the lowest percentage of charge-off rates, thus they are more trustable and may qualify to borrow more frequent and bigger amount of loans. "

    "We can also estimate the amount of money that each category of people may not pay back their loan. It is clear that grade-A category people have lesser chance to be charged-off, but they also may have bigger amount of loans compared to those of grade-G. Similarly, since people of grade-G category have higher risks not to pay back their loan, the amount of loan given to them may also be less. So it might be fair to look at the amount of loan each category borrows and calculate the approximate amount of loss. "

Although they have less risks compared to the grade-G borrowers, the amount of money they borrow may still lead to larger loss of money overall. Let's try to reflect this in the following calculation. We will estimate the loss of money for each group using their charge-off rates and the total amount of loan."

Some attributed were missing more than the others as we saw above and through couple of data cleaning process we were able to eliminate those values as well. This is just a short and approximate way of cleaning data from many meanigless parameters. We could spend more time and effort in order to reach better results, but I believe for  the purpose of this task this process might be enough to give us some idea about the structure of our data. "

    "Logistic Regression is a part of supervised machine learning where we need to train our system based on the data given in order to predict the discrete outcomes of the new data. From statistical point of view it is important to have all our data, whether it is the train data or the test data, to be from the same statistical sample. Logistic Regression is needed when we want to predict an outcome that has a discrete value, such as classification limited number of figures. Let's say we have a collection of labeled examples $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^N$, where N is the size of the collection, $x_i$ is the $D$-dimensional feature vector of example $i = 1, 2, ..., N $,  $y_i$ is the real valued target that has a discrete value of 0 or 1, and every freature $x_i^{(j)}, j = 1,...,D$ is also a real number.

Here $h_{\\theta}(x_{i})$ is the prediction of each example based on the features of $x_{i}$, $\\theta^{(j)}$ represents the collection of parameters, or weights, for each feature of $x_i$. The sigmoid function has such features so that when we are far from the zero point for $\\theta^T x_i$ it takes values either 0 or 1, which is a good function for logical operations.

    "Logistic regression is a statistical method for analysing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine the outcome. The outcome is expected to have binary values such as 1 or 0, Yes or No, True or False, based a set of independent variables. Logistic regression as a special case of linear regression when the outcome variable is categorical. Unlike actual regression, logistic regression does not try to predict the value of a numeric variable given a set of inputs. Instead, the output is a probability that the given input point belongs to a certain class. Even if there are several classes, not only two, each class can be assigned a logical True or False values depending on whether you find it or not. Thus any task with expected discrete outcome can be designed in a logical regression style. For example, you may want to categorize pictures of animals such as dog, cat, bird or fish. Each animal may be assigned a value of 1 (exist) or 0 (does not exist). We may create a vector of animals and organize them in a certain order like (dog, cat, bird, fish) and assign a vector with values (0, 0, 1, 0) if wee see a picture of a bird, or (0, 1, 0, 0) if we see a piture of a cat. Thus any problem that needs a discrete categorization may be designed to fit the logical regression problem. Unlike actual regression, logistic regression expects an outcome as 0 and 1, and for that we can use a special function named sigmoid function $g(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$ which has the following graphical view:"

    "This equation can be understood intuitively as follows: if $y = 0$, then the first term vanishes and  the second term will give  $log(1 - h_{\\theta}(x))$. This term is expected to be maximum,  which corresponds to $h_{\\theta}(x)$ being close to zero, the result we desire to achieve. But if $y = 1$, then the second term vanishes and the first term will give $log(h_{\\theta}(x))$, which can to be maximum if $h_{\\theta}(x)$ tends to be 1. Remember that $h_{\\theta}(x)$ has values between 0 and 1, that is $0 < h_{\\theta}(x) < 1$."

    "Our goal is that we want to maximize the likelihood function $l(\\theta)$. For this we need to tune the parameter $\\theta$ and this can be done by iterative calculation of $\\theta$. We initially guess $\\theta$ by assigning it some random value, then we slowly iterate our algorithm and update the values of $\\theta$ until we reach the point where the values of $\\theta$ do not change and then we stop. After all this iterative calculation we will obtain a final value for $\\theta$. Once we find it, we can use its value to calculate the outcome\n",
